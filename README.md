# üõ†Ô∏è ESP32 WiFi Marauder with SPI TFT Setup Guide

This project demonstrates how to convert a basic ESP32 Dev Board into a powerful wireless auditing tool using the open-source **WiFi Marauder** firmware. By pairing the ESP32 with a 2.8" SPI TFT LCD and optional antenna + power module, you can create a compact, portable, and touch-capable wireless scanner.

The setup allows you to perform:

* WiFi deauthentication and probe attacks
* Bluetooth device scanning
* Touchscreen interaction for menu navigation
* Real-time packet sniffing and signal strength mapping

In this guide, you‚Äôll find step-by-step wiring instructions, supported components, flashing tools, and tips for building a 3D-printed enclosure for protection.

Ideal for pentesters, CTF players, or wireless hobbyists, this project is plug-and-play once assembled properly.

Let‚Äôs dive in!

## üöÄ Flashing WiFi Marauder

1. Visit the official [WiFi Marauder Web Updater](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/update-firmware#using-spacehuhn-web-updater)
2. Connect your ESP32 to USB and select the COM port
3. Upload the files at these addresses:

| File Type  | Flash Address |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Bootloader | `0x1000`      |
| Partitions | `0x8000`      |
| Boot App   | `0xE000`      |
| Firmware   | `0x10000`     |

> These offsets apply to most ESP32 Dev Boards like NodeMCU-32S, Wemos D1 Mini, LDDB, etc.

## üîß Drivers for ESP32

If your ESP32 does not appear on the COM port, install the CH34x drivers:

## üõë Unsupported TFT Warning

Parallel 8-bit TFT displays (like the 2.4" Red Shields for Arduino UNO with pins `D0-D7`) are **NOT compatible** with WiFi Marauder. These require entirely different libraries and are not supported by the SPI-based firmware.

| Issue          | Description                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Interface Type | Parallel (8-bit)                           |
| Support        | ‚ùå Not supported by WiFi Marauder           |
| Fix            | Use SPI-based TFT like the REES52 2.8" TFT |

## üß± 3D Printed Case Option

To keep your ESP32 + TFT module safe and portable, you can design a custom 3D-printed case.

* üîß Platforms like [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) or [Printables](https://www.printables.com/) have community-contributed case designs.
* üñ®Ô∏è You can also use [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) to customize your own enclosure.
* üõí In my case, I ordered the 3D-printed case from [Robu.in](https://robu.in/), which offers printing services and enclosure design assistance for hobby electronics.
